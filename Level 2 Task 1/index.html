                <h2>About Bill Gates</h2>
                <p>Bill Gates, born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington, is a technology pioneer, business magnate, and philanthropist whose influence spans decades. As a young programmer, he developed a passion for computers at Lakeside School, where he wrote his first software program at age 13. This early curiosity led him to co-found Microsoft Corporation with Paul Allen in 1975, a venture that would redefine the tech industry. Gates' vision of making personal computing accessible to everyone materialized through innovations like MS-DOS and the Windows operating system, which became household names worldwide. He served as Microsoft's CEO until 2000, steering the company to become a global leader with a market value exceeding billions.</p>
                <p>Beyond his tech legacy, Gates shifted his focus to philanthropy after stepping down from his day-to-day role at Microsoft. In 2000, he and his then-wife Melinda established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has since become one of the largest private charitable organizations globally. The foundation tackles pressing issues such as global health, education, and poverty, funding initiatives like the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, malaria vaccine development, and efforts to improve sanitation in developing countries. Gates' personal commitment includes pledging over $50 billion to the Giving Pledge, inspiring other billionaires to donate their wealth. His annual "Gates Notes" blog offers insights on technology, health, and climate change, further cementing his role as a thought leader.</p>
                <p>Gates' life reflects a blend of intellect, resilience, and altruism. Despite dropping out of Harvard to pursue Microsoft, he returned in 2007 to receive an honorary degree, symbolizing his enduring impact. His investments in clean energy and artificial intelligence through Breakthrough Energy and his co-authored books, such as *How to Avoid a Climate Disaster*, highlight his forward-thinking approach. With a net worth fluctuating around $130 billion (as of recent estimates), Gates continues to shape the future, proving that innovation and compassion can coexist. His legacy is not just in technology but in the lives improved worldwide through his efforts.</p>
